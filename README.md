## Problem Statement
Employee attrition is a significant challenge for organizations. High attrition rates lead to workforce shortages, increased hiring costs, and overtime expenses. Effective workforce planning requires a balance between maintaining an optimal workforce size and minimizing associated costs.

## Key challenges addressed in this project:

-Estimating workforce needs based on employee attrition.

-Calculating the required hires for each department.

-Minimizing hiring and overtime costs while meeting workforce demands.

## Solution

This project uses Python and optimization techniques to:

Analyze workforce trends by department.

Estimate required workforce based on attrition rates.

Simulate hiring needs and associated costs for each department.

Visualize workforce allocation and cost estimates.

## Tools & Technologies

**Python Libraries**

pandas for data manipulation.

numpy for numerical computations.

scipy.optimize for optimization tasks.

matplotlib for visualizations.

Google Colab: Environment for running the code.

Dataset: HR Employee Attrition Dataset (uploaded manually).

## Expected Results
**Workforce Plan**: Departments with higher attrition rates will have more hires required.

**Cost Estimates**: Departments with larger workforce gaps will incur higher hiring costs.

## Obtained Results

**Workforce Allocation Visualization**: Clear representation of current workforce, hires needed, and total workforce for each department.

**Cost Analysis**: Estimated hiring costs for each department displayed in a bar chart.

**Optimization Insights**: Practical recommendations for workforce allocation and budget planning.
